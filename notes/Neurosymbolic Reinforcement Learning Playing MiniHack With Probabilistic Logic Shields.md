- motivation
	- help agent learn faster and safer by giving constraints
- introduced implementation: *open-source probabilistic logic shields for MiniHack*
	- deep RL + probabilistic logic reasoning
	- shielding is end-to-end differentiable
	- all environments have perfect sensors
	- shielding shows improvement in safety and sample-efficiency for:
		- moving obstacles
		- stochastic transition function
