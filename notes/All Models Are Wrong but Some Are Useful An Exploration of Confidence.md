#power-grid

- motivation
	- "changes in electricity production and consumption require adaptation of the electricity grid infrastructure"
	- forecasting energy demands into the next years or decades is hard
	- "An important factor in the validity of models is that only a limited number of context variables can be taken into account, while at the same time the context in which we operate is changing rapidly and unexpectedly"
- contribution
	- the authors summarize 11 interviews with modeling experts for the power industry
- take-aways
	- several reasons make energy forecasting uncertain: customer behavior, climate, politics, modeling errors
	- "respondents tend to talk about confidence in the predictions, rather than predictability of a situation"
	- "validity of model outcomes is experienced as low, but still useful to provide trends or intervals. A quote that illustrates this “We know the model is wrong but it gives us a good approximation.”"
