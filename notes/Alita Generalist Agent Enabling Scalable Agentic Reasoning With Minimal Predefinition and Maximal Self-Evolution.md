- introduced method: *Alita*
	- design principle: "simplicity is the ultimate sophistication" - da Vinci
	- one component for direct problem-solving -> "minimal predefinition"
	- bunch of components to construct, refine, and reuse external capabilities by generating task-related model context protocols (MCP) -> maximal self-evolution
- take-away: "simplicity in design does not undermine, but rather enhances, the performance and adaptability of generalist agents"
