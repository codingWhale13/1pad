- motivation
	- key to deep learning is network depth
		- but the high amount of layers also makes training hard due to more non-linearity
	- is there a better way
- introduced method: *FitNets*
	- idea: use knowledge distillation to imitate already trained deep networks
	- by making them thinner, they can also be deeper and thus more expressive
