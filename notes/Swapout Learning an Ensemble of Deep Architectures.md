![[Pasted image 20250418203048.png]]
- motivation
	- improve ResNets, by using both dropout and stochastic depth
- introduced method: *Swapout*
	- stochastic training scheme
	- generalization of dropout and stochastic depth methods
	- samples from per ResNet unit
		- dropout
		- stochastic depth
		- residual architectures
		- the picture says it all
- result
	- Swapout allows much shallower networks (albeit wider) with good performance
