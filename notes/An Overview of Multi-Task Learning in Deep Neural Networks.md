#MTL  #DL #LASSO

- motivation for MTL (multi-task learning)
	- instead of tweaking hyperparameters for every new single task, using training signals of related task is a promising way to increase performance (and maybe even training time)
	- Caruana 1998: "MTL improves generalization by leveraging the domain-specific information contained in the training signals of related tasks"
	- more meaningful inductive bias
		- instead of choosing e.g. $\ell1$ regularization (preferring sparse solutions)
		- MTL introduces an inductive bias in the form of auxiliary tasks
- flavors of MTL
	- joint learning
		- we want to learning all tasks at once
	- continuous learning ("learning to learn")
		- we want to start learning a task and then adapt to new tasks
	- learning with auxiliary tasks
		- we only really care about learning a single task, but we want to use MTL to improve the performance of that one task
		- considerations when picking auxiliary task(s)
			- related task, e.g. predicting class and coordinates of an object in an image
			- adversarial task, when labeled data of the opposite goal is easier to get
				- adversarial loss -> maximize training error
			- hints: predicting features
			- focusing attention: force model to learn X by predicting X as auxiliary task
			- quantization smoothing: instead of human-desired output such as low/medium/high, learn smoother divisions
			- predicting inputs: some feature might be unhelpful as inputs, but they could be helpful as outputs to predict
			- using the future to predict the present
				- e.g. more accurate measurements of line markings in autonomous driving
				- while original task of course doesn't have access to the future, the auxiliary task is free to learn this back-in-time relation
			- representation learning, e.g. auto encoder
		- caveat: there's currently no good notion of when two two tasks are similar or related (and if so, how, e.g. hierarchically)
- domains
	- NLP
	- speech recognition
	- computer vision
- two most common methods in deep MTL
	- hard parameter sharing
		- sharing hidden layers between all tasks + keeping output-layers task-specific
		- most common approach (going back to Caruana 1993)
		- reduces risk of overfitting by factor of N (N = number of tasks)
	- soft-parameter sharing
		- each task has its own (same-architecture) model with its own parameters
		- distance between parameters of the model is regularized, e.g. with $\ell 2$
- why it works
	- implicit data augmentation by increasing the effective sample size
	- attention focusing: fight noise by providing additional evidence on feature relevance
	- eavesdropping: some features might be easier to learn in auxiliary task; learn from it
	- representation bias: model prefers representation that models for other tasks found
	- regularization by introducing an inductive bias
- literature
	- classical methods (linear models, kernel methods, Bayesian algorithms) focus on two main ideas
		- enforcing sparsity across tasks through norm regularization
			- use block-sparse regularization to share only the most relevant features of the task parameter matrix
			- while focusing on most important features, they are shared across all tasks
		- modelling relationships between tasks
			- maybe we don't want to share information between all tasks, but just a few instead -> need to know how tasks are related
			- one idea: impose clustering constraint by penalizing both the norms of task column vectors as well as their variance
			- other idea: cluster regularization (mean, between, within)
	- neural models
		- deep relationship networks (predefined structure for sharing)
		- fully-adaptive feature sharing (learned structure for sharing)
		- cross-stitch networks (soft sharing approach)
		- low supervision (using task-hierarchies)
		- joint many-task model (predefined structure, hierarchical)
		- weighting loss with uncertainty (Gaussian likelihood with per-task uncertainty)
		- Tensor factorization for MTL
		- sluice networks (proposed by author, combines many of the above)
